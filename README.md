# MovietoMovie

In order to run this put all these files in the same directory and run the exe. There should be actor movies, actor names, and movie map txt files. Also, a parse.cpp and parse.exe. It will take about a minute to start showing up in the terminal once you run it.

The txt files are in this google drive (they're bigger than 25MB in total so I couldn't include them in the github)
